/*
Metric                | Meaning
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------
num_of_reads/writes  | Total read/write ops since SQL Server started
io_stall_read/write  | Total time (ms) SQL spent waiting for reads/writes to complete
AvgReadLatencyMs     | Time per read = stall time / ops (high = slow storage)
AvgWriteLatencyMs    | Time per write = same idea
physical_name        | Path to file â€“ helps identify which disk or mount is slow
