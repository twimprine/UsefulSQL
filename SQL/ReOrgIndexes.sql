/*
    This script identifies potential bottlenecks in SQL Server by analyzing wait statistics.
    It filters out common wait types that are not indicative of performance issues.
    
    The cursor iterates through all indexes in the database and checks their fragmentation levels. If the
    fragmentation is above 10%, it will either reorganize or rebuild the index based on the level of fragmentation.
